### This is a project i have worked for a World Robotics Championship competition called TECHNOXIAN and have a working line follower which has got an LSA-08 sensor, microcontroller stm32f401 and motor driver was mdd3A and powered by a battery voltage of 12V.

The code is written in STMCubeIDE and also the code works only for the UART mode 1 for LSA-08 sensor.
